Farmers E-commerce is a project made for farmers to sell their surplus. This will help them to sell their excess products.
The "Backend" folder contains the following structure:

app.js: This is likely the main application entry point.
server.js: Likely handles server setup and configurations.
config/: Configuration files (e.g., database, environment variables).
controllers/: Business logic for handling requests and responses.
middleware/: Custom middleware for request processing (e.g., authentication).
models/: Database schemas and models.
routes/: Route definitions for API endpoints.
utils/: Utility functions or helper modules.
I will now draft a detailed README file based on this structure. ​​

Here is the README file for your backend project:
